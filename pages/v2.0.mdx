# Reinforcement Learning Framework

Welcome to **v2.0** - our most ambitious release featuring a complete **Reinforcement Learning** framework! This major version introduces state-of-the-art RL algorithms, multi-agent systems, and distributed training capabilities.

## Major Features

### Core RL Algorithms

We've implemented the most advanced RL algorithms with optimized performance:

- **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)** - Stable policy gradient method
- **Deep Q-Networks (DQN)** - Value-based learning with experience replay
- **Actor-Critic (A2C/A3C)** - Advantage-based policy gradients
- **Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)** - Maximum entropy RL for continuous control
- **Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO)** - Conservative policy updates

### Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning

```python
from ai_platform import MultiAgentRL

# Multi-agent training environment
env = MultiAgentRL(
    algorithm="MADDPG",  # Multi-Agent DDPG
    agents=4,
    observation_space="continuous",
    action_space="discrete"
)

# Cooperative and competitive scenarios
agents = env.train(
    scenario="cooperative_navigation",
    episodes=10000,
    centralized_critic=True
)
```

### Advanced Training Techniques

#### Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)

```python
from ai_platform.rl import PPOAgent

# PPO with advanced features
agent = PPOAgent(
    policy_network="transformer",  # Attention-based policy
    value_network="cnn",
    clip_ratio=0.2,
    entropy_coeff=0.01,
    gae_lambda=0.95  # Generalized Advantage Estimation
)

# Training with curriculum learning
agent.train(
    env="custom_environment",
    total_timesteps=1_000_000,
    curriculum_stages=["easy", "medium", "hard"]
)
```

#### Deep Q-Networks with Improvements

```python
from ai_platform.rl import DQNAgent

# Rainbow DQN with all improvements
agent = DQNAgent(
    double_dqn=True,          # Double Q-learning
    dueling=True,             # Dueling network architecture
    prioritized_replay=True,   # Prioritized experience replay
    noisy_nets=True,          # Noisy networks for exploration
    distributional=True,      # C51 distributional RL
    multi_step=3              # Multi-step learning
)
```

## Real-World Applications

### Autonomous Trading

```python
# Financial trading agent
trading_agent = PPOAgent(
    observation_space=market_features,
    action_space=trading_actions,
    risk_constraints=True
)

# Backtesting on historical data
results = trading_agent.backtest(
    data=stock_data,
    initial_capital=100000,
    transaction_costs=0.001
)
```

### Robotics Control

```python
# Robot manipulation learning
robot_agent = SACAgent(
    observation_space=sensor_data,
    action_space=joint_torques,
    safety_constraints=True
)

# Sim-to-real transfer
robot_agent.train_in_simulation(
    simulator="pybullet",
    domain_randomization=True,
    reality_gap_reduction=True
)
```

## Breaking Changes

### API Restructuring

```python
# Before (v1.x)
from ai_platform.rl import DQN
agent = DQN(env, lr=0.001)
agent.train(episodes=1000)

# After (v2.0)
from ai_platform.rl import DQNAgent
agent = DQNAgent(
    observation_space=env.observation_space,
    action_space=env.action_space,
    learning_rate=0.001
)
agent.train(env=env, total_timesteps=1000000)
```
