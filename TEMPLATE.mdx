# Advanced AI Model Integration

Brief introduction to this AI/ML release. What's the main focus? What AI problems does it solve? How does it advance the field?

## What's New

### New AI Models

- **GPT-4 Turbo Integration** - Advanced language model with 128K context window
- **Multimodal Capabilities** - Vision + language processing for complex tasks
- **Fine-tuning Pipeline** - Custom model training with LoRA and QLoRA support

### ML Infrastructure

- Enhanced distributed training with automatic scaling
- Improved inference optimization with 60% faster response times
- Better GPU memory management for large models
- Advanced caching mechanisms for model predictions

### AI Engineering Tools

- Updated to latest Transformers library with new architectures
- Improved experiment tracking and model versioning
- Better integration with MLOps pipelines
- Enhanced debugging tools for neural networks

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed memory leaks in transformer attention mechanisms
- Resolved gradient explosion issues during large model training
- Corrected tokenizer behavior with special characters in multilingual models
- Improved numerical stability in loss function computations

## Breaking Changes

> **Warning**: This section is only needed if there are breaking changes

If this release includes breaking changes, list them here:

- **API Change**: Describe what changed and how to migrate
- **Configuration Update**: Explain new required settings
- **Dependency Update**: Note any version requirements

### Migration Guide

```javascript
// Before (old version)
const oldWay = api.oldMethod();

// After (new version)
const newWay = api.newMethod({
  // new required parameters
});
```

## Performance Improvements

| Metric       | Before | After | Improvement   |
| ------------ | ------ | ----- | ------------- |

| Bundle Size  | 1.2MB  | 850KB | 29% smaller   |
| Memory Usage | 45MB   | 32MB  | 28% reduction |

## Code Examples

### New AI Model Usage

```python
from ai_platform import LLM, FineTuner

# Load and use advanced language models
model = LLM("gpt-4-turbo")
response = model.generate(
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Explain quantum computing"}],
    max_tokens=500,
    temperature=0.7
)

# Fine-tune models on custom data
tuner = FineTuner(
    base_model="llama-2-7b",
    dataset="custom_domain_data",
    technique="LoRA"
)
custom_model = await tuner.train()
```

### Configuration Updates
